Version 2.1.0.0 2021-09-06

   Added support for redesigned class Orbit.

   Breaking changes:

   1. Removed Orbit.TleSetNumber; use Orbit.Elements.SetNumber.
   2. Removed Orbit.Inclination;  use Orbit.Elements.InclinationRad.
   3. Removed Orbit.RAAN;         use Orbit.Elements.RAANodeRad.
   4. Removed Orbit.ArgPerigee;   use Orbit.Elements.ArgPerigeeRad.
   5. Removed Orbit.Epoch;        use Orbit.Elements.Epoch.
   6. Removed Orbit.Bstar;        use Orbit.Elements.Bstar.
   7. Removed Orbit.RevAtEpoch;   use Orbit.Elements.RevAtEpoch.
   8. Renamed Orbit.IntlDesignator to Orbit.SatDesignator.
   9. Renamed.Orbit.SemiMajor      to Orbit.SemiMajorRec.
  10. Renamed.Orbit.SemiMinor      to Orbit.SemiMinorRec.
  11. Renamed.Orbit.Major          to Orbit.MajorRec.
  12. Renamed.Orbit.Minor          to Orbit.MinorRec.
  13. Renamed.Orbit.MeanMotion     to Orbit.MeanMotionRec.
  14. Renamed Orbit.PerigeeRec     to Orbit.PerigeeKmRec.
  15. Renamed Orbit.ApogeeRec      to Orbit.ApogeeKmRec.
  16. Removed methods Orbit.GetRad() and Orbit.GetDeg().
  17. Removed properties Orbit.TleLine1 and Orbit.TleLine2.

Version 2.0.0.0 2021-04-22

   Compile with Visual Studio 2019, target .NET Standard 2.0.

Version 1.4.1.0 2021-02-14

   Added property Orbit.IntlDesignator.
   Added property Orbit.RevAtEpoch.
   Added property Orbit.TleSetNumber.

   Breaking changes:

   1. Removed obsolete method Orbit.GetPosition(); use method
      Orbit.PositionEci() (two overrides).

Version 1.4.0.0 2020-02-17

   Fixed an issue where an orbit with an inclination of exactly
   zero degrees would cause NaN problems when initializing 
   deep space terms.

Version 1.3.0.0 2017-04-22

   Compile with Visual Studio 2017.
   Updated target framework to .NET Framework 4.6.1.

Version 1.2.1.0 2016-12-30

   Method Orbit.FinalPosition() was using a DateTime object to calculate the
   time component of the returned EciTime object. This caused all EciTime 
   objects returned from PositionEci() to have times rounded to the nearest 
   millisecond. Class Julian is now used instead.

Version 1.2.0.0 2014-06-19

   Added class Satellite.
   Method Orbit.GetPosition() (two overrides) is deprecated; use 
      method Orbit.PositionEci() (two overrides).

Version 1.1.1.0 2013-09-07

   Added properties Orbit.TleLine1 and Orbit.TleLine2.

Version 1.1.0.0 2012-10-27

   Updates for OrbitTools.Core changes:

      Class CoordGeo renamed Geo, added derived class GeoTime.
      Class CoordTopo renamed Topo.
      Use new classes EciTime, GeoTime, TopoTime.

   Breaking changes:
   
   1. Orbit.GetPosition() now returns type EciTime.

Version 1.0.5.0 2012-06-02

   Updates for OrbitTools.Core changes:

      Boolean "IsAeUnits" was removed from the constructor for class Eci.
      Eci.AeToKm() was removed.
      The enumeration VectorUnits was removed.
      Global functions to convert between degrees and radians were renamed.

Version 1.0.4.0 2011-12-19

   Fix Orbit.TPlusEpoch(); it was not using UTC time.

Version 1.0.3.0 2011-10-01

   Performance changes:

      1. Class Orbit now uses caching variables for common TLE orbital 
         parameters like inclination, argument of perigee, etc.

   Breaking changes:

      1. Method Orbit.MeanAnomaly() is now property Orbit.MeanAnomaly.
      2. Method Orbit.MeanAnomaly(DateTime) has been removed.

Version 1.0.2.0 2011-08-21 

   Compile with Visual Studio 2010.

Version 1.0.1.1 2011-05-17

   Renamed Orbit.RadGet() to Orbit.GetRad().
   Renamed Orbit.DegGet() to Orbit.GetDeg().
   
   Breaking changes:
   
      1. Changed Orbit.SatName() (2 overloads) into two properties:
         SatName and SatNameLong (a change that was erroneously dropped
         from version 1.0.0.0)
      2. Renamed property Orbit.mnMotion to Orbit.TleMeanMotion.
   
Version 1.0.1.0 2010-12-31

   Assembly marked as CLSCompliant(true), and ComVisible(false).
   Removed unused local from class NoradSDP4 c'tor.
   
Version 1.0.0.0 2010-09-26

   Split the OrbitTools project into two assemblies:
   
      Core.dll  - Contains core functionality such as Tle, Julian, etc.
      Orbit.dll - Contains SGP4/SDP4 and class Orbit functionality.

   Dividing the project into two assemblies allows an easier upgrade path
   for users who wish to transition to the Professional version of the
   software.

   Orbit.GetPosition() no longer throws class Exception, but instead
   throws class DecayException or class PropagationException.
   
   Compile with Visual Studio 2008.
               
   Breaking changes from prior (single assembly) release:
   
      1. Assembly name is Zeptomoby.OrbitTools.Orbit.dll, and requires
         assembly Zeptomoby.OrbitTools.Core.dll.
      2. Changed Orbit.SatName() (2 overloads) into two properties:
         SatName and SatNameLong.
      3. Renamed Orbit.mnAnomaly() (2 overloads) to MeanAnomaly().
      4. Renamed Orbit.getPosition() (2 overloads) to GetPosition().

                       ********************
Revision history below this point was for the single-assembly version of 
the library. Only comments relevant to the files that were moved into the 
Orbit.dll assembly have been retained. All other comments were moved into
the revision notes file for the Core.dll assembly.
                       ********************

Version 1.9.1.0 10/18/2009
   
   (Version incremented due to changes in Tle.cs)

Version 1.9.0.0 01/25/2009

   (Version incremented due to changes in Julian.cs)

Version 1.8.0.0 01/02/2009

   The orbit axis recovered from orbital elements is now correctly
   associated with the semimajor axis (and not the semiminor axis).
   This change does not effect SGP4/SDP4 output calculations, but
   does correct class Orbit's convenience properties SemiMajor, SemiMinor,
   Major, Minor, etc. Thanks to C. Wee for discovering this issue.

   Renamed class Orbit's public property "mnMotionRec" to "MeanMotion".

Version 1.7.0.0 12/08/2007
   
   Added overrides of several functions to accept System.DateTime arguments.
   Converted Orbit.Period() to a property and changed return type to TimeSpan.

Version 1.6.0.0 08/08/2007

   (Version incremented due to changes in Tle.cs)

Version 1.5.0.0 01/28/2006

   Namespace is now "Zeptomoby.OrbitTools".

Version 1.4.0.0 11/05/2005

   More interface rework; many methods are now properties.

Version 1.3.0.0 07/19/2005

   Fixed error in calculating Orbit.m_kmPerigeeRec (which is not used by
   the SDP4 or SGP4 algorithms). Accessor is now a property. Added Orbit.Apogee
   counterpart property.
   
Version 1.2.0.0 06/01/2005

   Rework interfaces using C# accessors. Minor code updates.

Version 1.1.0.0 12/01/2004
